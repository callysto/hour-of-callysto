# Hour of Callysto

This notebooks is inspired by the "Hour of Code" programs where students are introduced to computer science through a 1-hour in-class workshop. 

Students can navigate this notebook using the "slideshow" mode to get a basic introduction to Jupyter, Callysto, and Python. Students will explore the basics of coding with Python and build towards creating number sequences such as the Fibonacci sequence. Each learning point is small and concise, and followed by an opportunity experiment. This can be a self-paced lesson, although instructors may also take a follow-along/guided approach as well.

Neither students nor teachers are expected to have significant experience with the platform, although it does greatly help to have guided instruction and support.
